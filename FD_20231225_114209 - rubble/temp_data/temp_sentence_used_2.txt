Kidney Stones Urine Trouble
You're Gonna Make it After All
Good friends don't let you do stupid things alone
Life's a party rock your body
And That’s Why You Always Leave a Note
Your Secret Is Safe With My Indifference
Can I Pet Your Dog?
Comparison is the thief of Joy
Worlds Best Cup of Coffee
I Regret Nothing
Life Begins Where Fear Ends
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
History has its eyes on you
Guess why I smile?  uh, because it's worth it
My god you’ve gotten fat
this machine kills fascists
I Can and I Will
love now cry later
It's hard to enjoy practical jokes
I Am With You Always
What I should have said was nothing
I may be small, but I’ve got giant plans
I am at home among the trees
Dream Big Work Hard Stay Humble
Cause Two Can Keep A Secret if one of them is dead
Ladies stop tonguing the foyer
Dream Up Something Wild and Improbable
Speed Has Never Killed Anyone
Evil is Evil it's all the same
We're All Stories In The End, just make it good  one
You do not yield
Being a Social Worker Is Easy
darling i’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Hobbies Include a Spoon and Peanut Butter
don't make me an optimist, you will ruin my life
I have worked with the homeless
Screw your lab safety, I want super powers
A Hearts a Heavy Burden
The South Got Something To Say
I Wanna Be the Best
Push Until Something Happens
Pursue What Is Meaningful
I Want to Give Him Everything
What Stands In The Way Becomes The Way
I'm right on top of that Rose!
I'm An Accountan, Not A Magician
Start lower, I beg you
The Best Is Yet to Come
fine make me your villain
We need to talk about the ducks
I Work Harder Than An Ugly Stripper
