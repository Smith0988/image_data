Art is love made public
Don’t give up on something
A handshake is available upon request.
No Feeling is Final
Vaquita plea, Act decisively, preserve their oceanic haven
My driving scares me too
You do not Yield
The world is quiet here
Long is the Road, Short is the Life
Beautiful Minds Inspire Others
Conquer the unknown, let curiosity be your guide
Your Mission Should You Choose to Accept It
Heaven must be our home
Whatever it is I'm against it
No complaining about the lack of Wi-Fi
Boys Are Out Tonight, Huh?
Vaquita, A symbol of oceanic grace, let's safeguard their existence
THICK THIGHS SAVE LIVES
Exploration is my nature, freedom is my guide
Chase your dreams, not your fears
I Myself Am Strange & Unusual
i might be wrong but I doubt it
I Dive Too Much
if there is no cop around anything's legal
Toaster, beats the morning rush
Water is for Toilets
Happiness is found in small thing
Guardians of the blue, stewards of Tahoe's splendor
Protect the gem, cherish the Tahoe gleam
Toaster duel, challenge accepted
If not now then when
To travel is to live
What You Seek is Seeking You
Ask Me About My Lobotomy
Stay calm, they said Oops
You just got Litt up!
Sometimes It's Tough Being the Best
I'm Not Made of Eyes
Everything Happens for a Reason
The Revolution has begun!
I Will Praise Him
My Favorite Color is You
If you can dream it, you can do it
Slow down, pouches crossing ahead!
love it if we made it
One Day at a Time
Love You to the Moon
My mama didn’t raise no pendeja
