Love Actually is All Around
We ve always done it this way
Hike More, Worry Less
Sew Much To Do Sew Little Time
I speak fluent sarcasm
If you can dream it, you can do it
We Are All Stories
Somewhere, Something
Thoughts Are Not Facts
Read To Me & Tell Me I'm Pretty
studying to save your life
she believed she could so she did
Think Outside, No Box Required
But my mom says I'm cool
Stop whining and do your job!
The mountains are calling
All you need is love
another recovery
You Are Beautiful
everything happens for a reason
Everybody is a Genius
Creativity Is Power
FAILURE IS THE BEST TEACHER
I May Not Agree With a Word You Say
We Choose To Be Good
Today Is A Good Day To Write
The Revolution has begun!
I award you no points
he is half my soul
Sometimes It Be Like That
Be curious and non-judgmental
Don't stop until you're proud
surprise i'm drunk!
Until the very end
Let Succes Make The Noise
Open your mind before your mouth
More curiosity, less judgment
More Altitude Less Attitude
we are still good
No Rain, No Flowers
Set the World on Fire
Once Upon A Time
Remember that you have to die
Life goes on, days get brighter
Happiness can be found
Let the sea set you free
Only Mostly Dead
I feel so at Home
To the stars who listen
I Love my Husband
Always the tone of surprise
May the force be with you
And She Lived Happily Ever After!
Make it pink, make it blue
You Bow To No One
Darkness Cannot Drive Out Darkness
We Rise By Lifting Others
God is within her she will not fall
You Are Enough Just As You Are
It Isnt For The Few
