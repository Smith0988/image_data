Christmas calories don't count, right?
May your Christmas sparkle with happiness

Merry and bright Christmas vibes
Gleaming lights, joy takes flight
Tinsel in trouble, elf on the shelf snickering
Candlelight and Christmas delights
Sleigh queen, slay the season!
Tidings of comfort and joy!
Deck the halls with love and laughter
Naughty or nice? Choose wisely, Santa's watching!

Peace, joy, and love this Christmas
Joy to the world this Christmas
Sleigh my name, sleigh my game!
Warmest thoughts and best wishes
Frosty days, cozy nights ahead
Yuletide joy, eating cookies with abandon
Wishing you a sleigh full of happiness
Rudolph-approved happiness for you this season!
Sleighing the holidays, one laugh at a time
Snowflakes and smiles all around
Stockings stuffed, sanity stuffed, too
Sleigh the day with cocoa and laughter!
