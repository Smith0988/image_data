well behaved women rarely make history
Ain't that just the way
Think Happy. Be Happy.
Eternal blue, where heaven meets Tahoe's waters
You're Allowed To Take Up Space
snow lands on top
Cherishing Tahoe's legacy, nature's masterpiece
I hate stupid people
Books are easily destroyed
to indeed be a god
anyways, i'm gonna go cry in the bathroom
It's messed up, right?
Treat people with kindness
life is tough but so are you
you are not immune to propaganda
Brake for possum pockets of charm
Best Wishes, Warmest Regards
My idea of roughing it is a hotel without Wi-Fi
Gone with the Wind
Now is your time to bloom
Sorry I Was Sleeping
I Want To Pause Adulting
What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?
I Move the Stars for No One
If you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly
Love will have its sacrifices
You're going to reap just what you sow
In the dance of life, let your spirit lead
I’m sure that will get sorted out
what is wrong with you?
Slow down, pouches in the area
I welded it helded
it is not that deep
To Me, You Are Perfect
Life is an epic quest—seek the extraordinary in every moment
No complaining about the lack of legroom
There's no one I'd rather be than me
It's not a hill to die on
If I Collapse Pause My Watch
work hard play hard
My Dream Wouldn't Be Complete Without You
May We Meet Again
Venture boldly into the untamed canvas of life
Let God Transform You
In the pursuit of dreams, live wildly and free
Driver gets the best spot at the campsite
There’s Always Another Secret!
Say Perhaps To Drugs
Women Want Me Fish Fear Me
A wizard is never late
girl take your attendance
Fight for Vaquitas, Guardians of the ocean, defenders of biodiversity
Sore Today Strong Tomorrow
The World is Big
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
That's The Goddess In Me
Nurture Your Inner Garden
Tell Me That I Am Your Favorite Sin
What's meant to be will find a way
Hello, I'm Addicted To Buying Books
Let Succes Make The Noise
don't think. just do.
May we meet again
music of the night
Ease off, kangaroo mice crossing
Comparison Is The Thief Of Joy
The Book Was Better
Chill vibes, temporarily out
In Tahoe's embrace, find serenity's timeless touch
you're only as pretty as you treat people
Measure Once Cuss Twice
Living on the edge, chasing the extraordinary
Born to explore, destined to conquer the wild
Your Time Starts Now
What About Second Breakfast?
Cling To What Is Good
Be Kind to Yourself
I became a parking attendant for the money and fame
Where You Lead, I Will Follow
I became a waiter/waitress for the money and fame
Blaze trails and create adventures worth sharing
The Wild is Calling
She Believed She Could So She Did
thanks, it's the trauma
Pouch patrol, slow and steady
I became a pet groomer for the money and fame
That’s What She Said
you are not the footballer
Look at where you are
I've Made A Huge Mistake
Books, the best companions in life's journey
May your day be as satisfying as unsalted popcorn
My People Skills Are Rusty
Driver has final say on pit stops
Chasing the sun, dancing in the moonlight, living untamed
all the people are fake
Driver gets the first shower
Get In Good Trouble
