And if not, He is still good
I understood that reference
I Rise Above It All
You can never have too many rocks
Keep watering the good seeds
I am not the meek and obedient type
Its Your Breath In Our Lungs
the rest is silence
Go Into All the World
It's not a hill to die on
honest to god knock me out
A dream is a wish your heart makes
It’s not a phase, it’s who I am
Underestimate me, that'll be fun!
You Never Know How Strong You Are
I know you’re obsessed with me
family over everything
She Believe She Could So She Did
We see each other!
Our Future Is Up To Us
I'm Not Made of Eyes
I Read Past my Bedtime
HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY
Courage is not the absence of fear
Fearfully And Wonderfully Made
Eat Like Nobody's Watching
let the good times roll
This feels like the end
Today Is Going To Be Amazing!
don't have a crap attack
Never be so kind you forget to be clever
I choose to live by choice, not by chance
Engineer Problem solver
Children prevented many accidents
It’s my bad to put my hands on you
I’m sure that will get sorted out
