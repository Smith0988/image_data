It's okay to not be okay.
Love You to the Moon
Only You Can Decide What Breaks You
Lord let them see you in me
The Wild is Calling
You had me at boys to torment
Making Mistakes Is Human
there is Always Something to be Thankful For
Do something new everyday
Be A Bad Ass With A Good Ass
Nobody Cares Work Harder
Ain't No Thing Like Me, Except Me
Once Upon A Time, This Is Who I Am
You see me, you see me more
it is well with my soul
Blossom Wherever Life Plants You
Baby, don't get greedy
this is The House That Hustle Built
Even miracles take a little time
Who's Gonna Carry The Boats
Work Hard and Be Kind
say it, before it's too late
i have no idea what i'm doing
What You Seek is Seeking You
facts do not care about Your Feeling
Live In A Van Down By The River
Iâ€™d rather be at the beach
Enjoy The Little Things
I've got a bone to pick with you
To live for the hope of it all
I hate stupid people
Have courage and be KIND
