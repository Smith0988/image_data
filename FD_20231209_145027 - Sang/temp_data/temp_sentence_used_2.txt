It Was Real to Me
If You Wanna Be Somebody
Peace left the building
Cruise control for America's pouch posse
I speak fluently in movie
Race tip, Toaster uses jet fuel
I'm Silently Judging Your Wiring
I BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF LOVE
we are still good
Im silently correcting your grammar
Debate Team We Have Issues
as you can see, I'm a lot happier
Hope your day is as eventful as my sock drawer
Anonymous was a woman
Sometimes It Be Like That
Only Act Like I Know Everything
Books! The best weapons in the world!
You're Not My Supervisor
I'm so sick of Congress
My Broom Broke So I Became an Accountant
find what you love let it kill you
I'll Bring The Bad Decisions
Don't let the hard days win.
yuhhh get into it
She Leaves A Little Sparkle Wherever She Goes
Guardians of the Sierra, Defenders of Tahoe's Blue
Toaster, roadrunner of breakfast lanes
Explore the wild side of life's grand tapestry
No sleeping on the trip
Simple is not easy
GOOD THINGS ARE AHEAD
I Exist Without My Consent
Customers are not right on my shift
Put A Bird On It
Im Right On Top Of That Rose
Goddamn, it's good to be a ghost hunter
It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this.
Do not fear The Mist
Everything is a copy
Nature's masterpiece, Tahoe's waters weave
I’m not convinced I know how to read
Dads you are enough just as you are
Guardians of clarity, Tahoe's timeless defenders
let the good times roll
Race with a toaster, burnt ego
Can you afford to be an individual?
I choose to live by choice, not by chance
May your day be as smooth as a sandpaper handshake
Driver gets to choose the first activity
To live for the hope of it all
