the library is a Wilderness of Books
Don’t you dare settle for fine
You Can’t Take Loved Away
FLOWERS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG
All Bodies Are Good Bodies Body
Difficult Roads Often Lead To Beautiful Destinations
You are not alone
Happiness is found in small thing
Life Isn't Fair, It Is Balanced
love is awful
I Workout Because Punching People Is Frowned Upon
Support Your Local Bartender
oh yeah, terribly funny, really witty
The Mountains are Calling, and I Must Go
We do not remember days, we remember moments
the whole being dead thing
Imagine All the People Living Life in Peace
TRUTH IS THE NEW HATE SPEECH
Another Fine Day Ruined by Responsibility
Heaven must be our home
I'm Tired Of Thinking About Things
Beautiful girl, you can do hard things
Smiling is my Favorite
We Rise by Lifting Others
Reading and coffee because murder is wrong
I just cry sometimes it's no big deal
You're My Wonderwall
I KNOW THAT I KNOW NOTHING
introverted but willing to discuss books
My Broom Broke So I Became an Accountant
well behaved women rarely make history
But what is grief if not love persevering
alright dude, go trip over a knife
I didn't go through all that for nothing
Make today your bitch
Who's Gonna Carry the boats
Stop acting like a disgruntled pelican
you are utterly indecent
Let's keep the dumbfuckery to a minimum today
All Choices Have Consequences Choose Wisely
