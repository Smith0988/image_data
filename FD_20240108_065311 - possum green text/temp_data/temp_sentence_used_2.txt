Adulting is a scam
Living for the memes, not the dreams
Slaying the adulting game, but barely
My sense of humor is as dry as my shampoo
I'm not a control freak, but you should do it my way
I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode
I'm not antisocial, I'm selectively avoiding stupidity
Cancelled my subscription to adulthood
Eating snacks and ignoring texts
Being an adult is the worst decision ever
My superpower is overthinking
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right
WiFi stronger than my relationships
I'm not rude, I'm just brutally honest
Lowkey stressing, highkey blessing
Chillin' like a villain
Napping is a sport, and I'm an athlete
Savage AF, but in a cute way
Eating my feelings, one snack at a time
Sarcasm is my only defense
Pizza is my love language
Stressed, blessed, and coffee obsessed
Running on caffeine and dry shampoo
Ctrl+Z can't fix my life
Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate
Flexing like my Wi-Fi signal
Life's a mess, and so is my hair
My room's a mess, but so is my life
Mood swings and chicken wings
Procrastinating like there's no tomorrow
Caffeine and sarcasm, my only filters
I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode, indefinitely
Did I ask? No, but go off
I'm not a procrastinator, I'm on a break from productivity
That's sus, gotta vote them off
